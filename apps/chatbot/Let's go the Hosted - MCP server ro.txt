Let's go the Hosted -> MCP server route. How hard is this? is there a lightweight way to set that up? Every time I paste into the local -> custom path i save it, and it then seems to remove most of my content. It is weird. But doesn't seem to workChatGPT said:Thought for 46sGreat call—Hosted → MCP Server is a clean, lightweight path. You only need a tiny MCP server with one tool that POSTs to your URL. Here’s the shortest way to get it running and wire it into Agent Builder.What you’ll buildA minimal MCP server with a single tool named calculatePortfolioReturns(assets, weights, startDate, endDate) that does:POST https://investment-chatbot-1.vercel.app/api/portfolio/calculateThen you’ll add that server to your Agent via Tools → Hosted → MCP Server.1) Minimal MCP server (Python, FastMCP)Installuv pip install "modelcontextprotocol[fastmcp]" httpxserver.pyfrom typing import List, Dict, Anyfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCPimport httpxmcp = FastMCP("portfolio-server")@mcp.tool()async def calculatePortfolioReturns( assets: List[str], weights: List[float], startDate: str, endDate: str) -> Dict[str, Any]: """ Calls the external portfolio calculator API.

You just need a public HTTPS URL and one tool; no UI/components required. OpenAI GitHub+1
Docs also note using a tunnel like ngrok to expose your local server during dev. OpenAI DevelopersPrefer Python? Use FastMCP (official Python SDK) for the quickest server; it auto-generates tool schemas from type hints and supports streamable HTTP out of the box. GitHub+12) Wire it into Agent BuilderIn your Agent (visual workflow):Tools → + → Hosted → MCP ServerServer label: portfolioServer URL: your public URL (e.g., https://<subdomain>.ngrok.app/mcp)(Optional) Headers if you protect your server (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <token>)Save. You should now see the MCP server’s tools (one named calculatePortfolioReturns) available to your agent/workflow.In your visual workflow, add a Tool Call node that calls calculatePortfolioReturns and map inputs:assets → e.g., ["AAPL","MSFT"]weights → e.g., [0.6,0.4]startDate → e.g., "2023-01-01"endDate → e.g., "2024-12-31"(Optional) In your agent instructions, add one line to control when it fires:When the user asks to compute portfolio performance, call calculatePortfolioReturns with the four inputs and summarize the API result.Reference: The OpenAI Agents SDK docs cover Hosted MCP tools (Responses API calls your remote MCP server), plus alternative transports. OpenAI GitHub+1Alternative: Minimal Node/TypeScript serverIf you prefer Node, use the official TS SDK:npm i @modelcontextprotocol/sdk undici// server.tsimport { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";import { z } from "zod";import { request } from "undici";const server = new McpServer({ name: "portfolio-server", version: "1.0.0" });server.registerTool( "calculatePortfolioReturns", { title: "Calculate portfolio returns", inputSchema: { assets: z.array(z.string()), weights: z.array(z.number()), startDate: z.string().describe("YYYY-MM-DD"), endDate: z.string().describe("YYYY-MM-DD") } }, async ({ assets, weights, startDate, endDate }) => { const res = await request("https://investment-chatbot-1.vercel.app/api/portfolio/calculate", { method: "POST", headers: { "content-type": "application/json" }, body: JSON.stringify({ assets, weights, startDate, endDate }) }); const data = await res.body.json(); return { content: [{ type: "json", json: data }] }; });// start an HTTP (streamable) MCP endpointserver.httpServer({ host: "0.0.0.0", port: 8000 });Run it (node server.js) and add https://<host>/mcp to Agent Builder. The TS/JS MCP guide shows the server and hosted MCP usage patterns. OpenAI GitHubIs this “hard”?Not really. For your single-URL use case:~30–40 lines of server codeOne command to run itOne field in Agent Builder (Hosted → MCP Server) to point at itIf you hit a snag, tell me which stack (Python or Node) you’re using and where you’re deploying (local+ngrok, Vercel/Render/Fly). I’ll adjust the snippet and give you the exact URL path and headers to paste into the Agent Builder form.You said:OK, let me try one more option prior to doing the MCP server. Here is what I just tried. I coded the prompt to go to the Code interpreter when asked about portfolio returns. Code Interpreter has a python code loaded. I'll include below. When I ran a test, it didn't work because the openai agent could not get to the endpoint for some reason. Here is the log from that session:Considering Python calculationsI think we should run a calculation using the Python tool. The instructions say to use Calculate_portfolio_returns.py via the code interpreter, and we have a file path to do that. It looks like we can't access an external API, but we can simulate things by reading the file and running local calculations. It would be easier to propose a default set of fund components and compute returns through the local script, but I need to know the expected inputs first!Running the script with defaultsI'm thinking we can run the script with default inputs. For the case of R=70, I'd set the portfolio components as follows: US Equity 18, International 7, Bonds 58, Gold 7, Bitcoin 3, and Cash 7. We'll need returns data over the last 18 months for each ETF, but it looks like the script will fetch this from somewhere. Since we can't access live data, I'll let the user know we can only approximate using historical returns for 18 months. Let's attempt to execute the Python script!Addressing web API limitationsI'm seeing that the script is trying to make a web API call, but it looks like we have no internet access. So, we won't be able to actually make that call. In this case, I think I should let the user know that I can’t access external APIs. Since they uploaded a file, we can either try to approximate things manually or use a placeholder. I can suggest running with default values or ask them to provide tickers or period returns for each asset. I'll keep it concise!DoneI can’t fetch live data from that API here. The script you uploaded calls an external endpoint, which isn’t accessible in this chat.The log indicates there is no internet access. Is that right? So I can't have it fetch from a pre-defined url??ChatGPT said:Thought for 29sShort answer: yeah—Code Interpreter (a.k.a. Advanced Data Analysis) runs your Python in a sandbox with no arbitrary outbound internet. So a requests.post("https://…") from that tool will fail. To hit your HTTP URL you need a network-capable tool (an Action/OpenAPI tool or a Hosted → MCP Server tool). That’s exactly what OpenAI’s agent docs recommend: use tools to connect agents to external systems, not the Python sandbox. OpenAI Developers+1Here are your practical paths:If you stay with Code InterpreterTreat it as offline compute. Upload the data (CSV/Parquet of prices/returns), or cache a dump produced by your API, and have the Python script compute returns locally (no web calls).Good for reproducible calcs; not for calling your live endpoint.If you want to call your URL (recommended)Use the Hosted → MCP Server you were leaning toward. It’s lightweight:1) Run a tiny MCP server (Python)uv pip install "modelcontextprotocol[fastmcp]" httpx# server.pyfrom typing import List, Dict, Anyfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCPimport httpxmcp = FastMCP("portfolio-server")@mcp.tool()async def calculatePortfolioReturns( assets: List[str], weights: List[float], startDate: str, endDate: str) -> Dict[str, Any]: async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=30) as client: r = await client.post( "https://investment-chatbot-1.vercel.app/api/portfolio/calculate", json={"assets": assets, "weights": weights, "startDate": startDate, "endDate": endDate}, headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"}, ) r.raise_for_status() return r.json()if __name__ == "__main__": mcp.run(mode="streamable-http", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)Run it:uv run server.pyExpose it during dev:ngrok http 80002) Wire it into Agent Builder (visual workflow)Tools → + → Hosted → MCP ServerLabel: portfolioURL: https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.app/mcpAdd a Tool Call node that invokes calculatePortfolioReturns and map assets, weights, startDate, endDate.(Optional) Add a one-liner in your agent instructions:
“When the user asks to compute portfolio performance, call calculatePortfolioReturns with the four inputs and summarize the JSON response.”OpenAI’s MCP docs + Agents SDK cover Hosted MCP tools; this is the intended way to let agents call external HTTP services. OpenAI Platform+1Quick fallback if you must avoid MCP right nowIf your Local → custom (OpenAPI Action) field keeps truncating, paste the tiny JSON version (it’s under their size limits in many tenants):{"openapi":"3.1.0","info":{"title":"Portfolio","version":"1"},"servers":[{"url":"https://investment-chatbot-1.vercel.app"}],"paths":{"/api/portfolio/calculate":{"post":{"operationId":"calculatePortfolioReturns","requestBody":{"required":true,"content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"type":"object"}}}},"responses":{"200":{"description":"OK"}}}}}}Then enforce the exact payload in your Tool Call node. (If the UI still trims it, go MCP.)Bottom line: Code Interpreter can’t fetch your URL; use Hosted MCP (or a compact OpenAPI Action) for network calls. If you want, tell me your deploy preference (local+ngrok, Render/Fly/Cloud Run), and I’ll give you the exact deploy command and the URL to paste into the Hosted → MCP Server box.You said:In step one, I am getting that from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP doesn't work because it can't find server.fastmcpChatGPT said:Thought for 16sYep — that error means you’re importing from the old path.FastMCP changed its import in v2.0.

On the free plan, the URL usually changes each time you restart. (Paid plan can reserve a fixed subdomain.)Sanity check (optional)From any terminal:curl -X POST https://pale-rabbit-1234.ngrok-free.app/mcp -d '{}' -H "content-type: application/json"You should at least get a structured MCP response (or a 200/JSON handshake). If you see 502/404:Make sure your server is running on port 8000.Ensure the path is /mcp in both your server code and the URL you pasted.If you changed ports, update both server.py and the ngrok http <port> command.Common gotchasWrong path: Your code uses path="/mcp", so your URL must end with /mcp.Firewall/VPN: Some corporate networks block tunnels; try a different network.Port mismatch: If Python says “address already in use,” pick another port (e.g., 8050) and run ngrok http 8050 (and update the MCP Server URL in Agent Builder).Changing URL: Free plan rotates the subdomain; re-paste the new one into Agent Builder when you restart ngrok.If you paste the exact Forwarding URL ngrok shows (with /mcp at the end) into the Hosted → MCP Server box, your agent should immediately see the calculatePortfolioReturns tool.
